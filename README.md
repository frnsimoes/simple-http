Just a simple http implementation to learn how things work behind the hoods.

Trying to:
- Implement a server without using any libraries besides `socket`.
- Implement a basic WSGI server.
- Implement basic Response and Requests abstractions.
- Deal with the messy details of socket and http details.

No dependencies.
